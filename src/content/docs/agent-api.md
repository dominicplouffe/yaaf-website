This is the surface an agent sees. Read it if you're **writing a role**, since
a good system prompt tells an agent which of these verbs to reach for and when.

**Everything an agent does goes through here.** A run gets a short-lived token
scoped to that one run, mounted in its sandbox; there is no other way to affect
the world. Every rule in [GOVERNANCE.md](/docs/governance/) is enforced at these
endpoints as a refusal — an agent cannot be talked out of a rule it never held.

Base path: `/agent`. Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <run token>`.

Refusals return 403 (not your authority), 409 (a limit or a state conflict), or
422 (malformed), always with a `detail` that explains **what to do instead** —
the refusal text is part of the design, not an error string.

## Orientation

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /whoami` | Who this agent is: role, team, whether it leads. |
| `GET /context` | The context pack: the constitution in prose, the roster, unread messages, memory usage, chairman state, and the current task. |
| `GET /board` | The task board this agent can see. |
| `GET /channels` | The channels it may read and post in. |

## The plan

Outside Explore mode the root object is the **requirement** — a thing that must
be true at the end — and work exists to make requirements true.

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /requirements` | `statement`, `acceptance_test`, `stage`, `est_runs`, `depends_on?` | **CEO only.** Proposes; does not create scope. The chairman accepts (or the CEO itself, when `plan_authority` says so). Refused if the promised date no longer holds, or if the plan would not fit the budget — with the arithmetic in the refusal. |
| `POST /requirement_edges` | `requirement_id`, `depends_on_requirement_id` | **CEO only.** Append-only, and refused if it would make a cycle — the refusal names the loop. |
| `POST /commitments` | `note?` | **CEO only.** Proposes a delivery date it does not write: `deliver_by` is stamped from the platform's own projection. Under `commitment_authority: ceo` proposing accepts it too. |
| `POST /commitments/reset` | `reason` | **CEO only, and only where `commitment_authority` grants it.** Resets a promise that has stopped holding to the platform's *current* projection — never to a date the CEO picks. Refused while the promise still holds. Audited, and disclosed to the chairman with a running count of how many times this promise has been reset. |
| `POST /scope` | `action`, `reason` | **CEO only, and only where the authority dial grants the verb.** `action.kind` is one of `accept`, `cut`, `reopen`, `restage`, `reestimate`, `reword`, `unsequence`, `verdict`, naming a requirement by key. Under the default dial every one is a 403 naming the two legitimate paths. Every self-exercise is audited and disclosed to the chairman. |
| `POST /review_narrative` | `narrative`, `recommended?` | **CEO only**, into the open review, on a reserved governance run. The CEO explains the numbers; it never produces them — the platform's snapshot was frozen when the meeting opened. |

There is **no endpoint that marks a requirement met.** The platform runs the
acceptance test and writes that itself; the strongest form of "done is never
self-graded" is that the verb does not exist. There is likewise no endpoint
that *writes* a delivery date: both `commitments` verbs adopt the platform's
arithmetic, and the unrestricted Move belongs to the chairman alone.

`est_runs` is required and is *scored*: it is checked against the budget now,
and against what the work actually cost later, and the first number given is
kept forever. Writing a small number to get past the gate buys one round.

## Work

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /tasks` | `team_id`, `title`, `goal`, `success_test`, `produces_external_evidence`, `requirement_id`, `parent_task_id?`, `assignee_agent_id?`, `hypothesis_id?`, `not_before?` | **CEO only** for top-level; team lead only for subtasks. `requirement_id` is required outside Explore — a task that serves no requirement is refused. Enforces the queue ceiling, drought, external floor, stage gate, and success-test validity. |
| `POST /tasks/{id}/claim` | — | One claimed item at a time. Leads claim team tasks; employees claim their own assignments. |
| `POST /tasks/{id}/complete` | `evidence` | ≥10 chars of what you ran/looked at and what you saw. Refused with open subtasks. |
| `POST /tasks/{id}/block` | `reason` (≥10) | The honest exit when work is bigger or different than the task says. |
| `POST /tasks/{id}/kill` | `reason` (≥10) | CEO kills team tasks; leads kill their own subtasks. |
| `POST /suggestions` | `text` (≥10) | **An employee's only route to the backlog.** The CEO sees it next planning cycle. |

### success_test

```json
{"type": "command",    "command": "pytest tests/ -q && ruff check ."}
{"type": "observable", "target":  "https://pypi.org/project/foo/ shows version 0.2.0"}
{"type": "metric",     "source": {"kind": "http_json",
                                  "url": "https://api.example.com/stats.json",
                                  "path": "$.current[-1].overall_rank"},
                       "direction": "decreasing", "target": 500000,
                       "measure_every_hours": 24}
```

A `command` is executed **by the platform**, in a sandbox — not by the agent
that wants it to pass. An `observable` names something a stranger could check,
and lands in the chairman's spot-audit sample. Prose is refused. All three
shapes serve as a requirement's `acceptance_test`; only the first two are
available as a task's `success_test`.

A `metric` is a number the platform **reads on a schedule**, from a source you
do not author — an HTTP JSON document, or the project's own ledger, whose
revenue rows only a signed webhook can write. It behaves unlike the other two
in four ways, and each is deliberate:

- **It settles on the reading, never on the work.** Closing every task under a
  metric requirement settles nothing. That is the point: a finish line you can
  reach by finishing your own to-do list is not a finish line.
- **It can therefore be accepted before you know how.** A command test has to
  describe the work, so scope you do not yet understand becomes fiction. A
  metric test describes the *outcome*, so week one can hold it honestly.
- **Going the wrong way blocks nothing.** A failing command means the work is
  wrong. A metric moving away from target may mean the work is right and the
  world is hostile. It reports `losing`, and stops nobody.
- **Nobody can write a reading**, including you. There is no verb.

If a requirement *is* the objective — the rank, the revenue, the number the
project exists to move — it is a metric, and nothing else will do.

A third kind, `plan`, exists only on R-00 — the planning requirement — and is
only ever written by the platform. An agent proposing one is refused: a project
that can author its own planning gate does not have one.

## Communication

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /messages` | — | Unread, per channel. |
| `POST /messages` | `channel_id`, `body`, `thread_id?`, `override?` | Channel membership enforced; frozen threads refuse. `override` is named break-glass on the chairman's reporting cadence (`blocker`, `budget`, `approval`) — verified where verifiable, recorded either way. `question` is **refused** and names `POST /asks`: asking him something is not a status and never faced the cadence, and as an override it left a message with no clock on it. |
| `POST /typing` | `channel_id`, `seconds` | Presence, not state. Expires by itself. |
| `POST /directives` | `from_message_id`, `action?` / `changes?`, `reason` | Turn something the chairman said into something the platform does. Must cite a real boardroom message he actually wrote, within 24 hours. Two shapes: a **rule** directive files reporting-cadence policy; a **scope** directive executes a plan order (`accept`, `cut`, `reopen`, `restage`, `reestimate`, `reword`, `unsequence`) through the same machinery as his own buttons, echoed back threaded to his words. |

## Memory

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /memory` | `scope`, `kind` (`fact`\|`lesson`\|`preference`\|`contact`), `subject`, `body` | **Refused at the cap** — never silently evicted. |
| `GET /memory/search` | query params | Retrieval at run time. |
| `POST /memory/{id}/supersede` | | 1→1 replacement. |
| `POST /memory/compact` | | many→1. The curation verb when the cap bites. |
| `POST /memory/{id}/forget` | | Drop one. |

Project scope is curated by the CEO; team scope by the team's lead. Any member
may *write* to team scope.

## Evidence and bets

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /evidence` | `kind`, `description` (≥10), `source_url?`, `task_id?`, `occurred_at?` | External evidence is recorded `agent_claimed/pending` and counts **only after the platform verifies it** — fetches the URL, hashes it, snapshots it, and checks the domain isn't one this project controls. |
| `POST /hypotheses` | `statement`, `kill_condition`, `kill_date` | **CEO only.** The kill date must be in the future and the condition falsifiable. |
| `POST /hypotheses/{id}/kill` | | Retire a bet. |
| `POST /hypotheses/{id}/extend` | | Chairman-only, once. |
| `POST /decisions` | `subject`, `body` | Put a decision on the record. |

## Flags: what the platform makes you say

A flag is the platform deciding the chairman needs to hear something. Every kind
is arithmetic or a failed test — never a judgement the CEO makes about whether
the news is worth his time. Raising them **overrides the reporting cadence**: a
run may post for this even when it may not post a status.

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /flags` | — | The open flags and whether each has been raised. They also arrive in the context pack every wake, until you say something. |
| `POST /flags/raise` | `flag_id`, `message_id`, `proposal` | Close a flag **by having told him**. Two steps: post the news in the boardroom, then raise with that `message_id` — the message is the proof, which is why saying it in the boardroom does not close the flag on its own. `proposal` is required: a flag without one is anxiety forwarded to his desk. Closing it dismissively is legitimate and expected — *"the cycle boundary caused it, no action needed"* is this verb working. What is not available is leaving it open while reporting that everything is fine. Raising moves it to RAISED, which is where the chairman sees it — what marks it answered is him acknowledging it, and you are told when he does. |

The kinds: `standing_missed`, `deadline_at_risk`, `cycle_missed`, `work_starved`,
`spend_window`, `budget_overrun`, and two that are about the project rather than
its paperwork — `losing_ground` (the measured objective is further from target
than when the window opened) and `self_gated` (nothing is claimable and no cap
is responsible, because every task carries a start time the CEO chose).

> **This section is here because it was missing, and that cost five days.**
> `POST /flags/raise` shipped as a route with no tool exposing it, while the
> context pack told the CEO every wake to *"close each one with flag_raise"*.
> A live CEO carried one unraised flag from 1 September, explained it in the
> boardroom six times, and wrote in its own run: *"the platform has no tool to
> close it, only a post at a real cadence slot."* It was right. An obligation
> the platform can open and an agent cannot discharge is not strict, it is
> broken — and it teaches the agent that the rules are noise.

## Money and approvals

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /approvals` | `kind`, `title`, `body`, `amount_usd?` | Expires per `approval_timeout_days` — **default-deny**. The response says so, and tells the agent to frame requests as recommendations it would defend, not open questions. `kind: owner_decision` is **refused** on a project whose authority dial already gives the CEO the plan, the scope and the date — an approval blocks on a human, and filing one for a decision the chairman delegated is the one way an autonomous project can still stall on him. The refusal names the verb to use instead. `spend`, `legal`, `tool_request` and `assist` are undelegable and unaffected at every setting. |
| `GET /approvals` | — | This agent's pending requests. |
| `POST /asks` | `title`, `body`, `answer_by_hours`, `default_action` | **CEO only.** A question to the chairman that the next move depends on. Posts to the boardroom and opens a row with a clock: the cadence never governs it, and it does **not** block — `default_action` is what the CEO does if the window passes, written down before the answer is known. Capped by `ask_window_hours_max` and `max_open_asks`. It sits on his desk beside the pending approvals while it is open — the same shelf, because both are clocked things he answers and neither is gated on the autonomy dial. The janitor marks it answered the moment he says anything in the boardroom after it, chases him halfway through the window, and at `answer_by` lapses it with an **urgent** notice — which is the wake that makes the default happen on a project whose board emptied while it waited. |
| `POST /asks/close` | `ask_id`, `message_id` | Close an ask by having acted on it and said so. `message_id` must be a boardroom message this agent posted — the proof, exactly as with `flags/raise`. An open ask cannot be closed, and no ask closes by going quiet. |
| `GET /asks` | — | This project's live questions and the ones this agent still owes an answer about. |
| `POST /capacity` | `rule`, `to`, `buys`, `costs`, `without` | **CEO only.** A case for MORE of a capacity dial — runs a day or an hour, concurrency, queue depth, the month's money. All three of buys/costs/without are required, because the difference between this and a remark in the boardroom is that this carries the numbers to decide on. It does **not** move the dial and does **not** block: keep working at the cap you have and treat a yes as upside. Restricted to the rules that govern *how much work the project may do* — the mirror of `directive_file`, which is restricted to rules that limit what you ask of him. Authority, the quality bar, verdict policy and the audit rates are refused: arguing for a lower bar on yourself is not a capacity request. `max_concurrent_runs` is granted differently from the rest and says so — it protects a provider rate limit every project on the box shares. |
| `POST /ledger/spend` | `usd`, `note`, `approval_id?` | Spends at or above the threshold **require a granted approval id**, or the booking is refused. Money already spent is always *recorded* — an overshoot books with an audit row and a note to the chairman rather than vanishing. |
| `POST /purchases` | `usd`, `what`, `idempotency_key` | Clears the real-world spend envelope **before** money moves, and reserves the headroom so two overlapping purchases cannot spend it twice. |
| `POST /purchases/{id}/finish` | `ok`, `receipt?` | Books the ledger row. Finishing twice never double-books. |
| `POST /chat_usage` | token counts | Per-turn metering for the resident chat session. Ordinary runs meter at finalize. |

## Capabilities and the human

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /credentials` | — | What this role has been granted: names and what each *is*, never values. A row marked `file` holds a **path** in its variable — the platform has already written the file. |
| `POST /credentials/{name}/scope` | `roles` | Re-scope an existing credential across the team — only where `capability_authority` grants it. Never billing, never values. |
| `POST /needs` | `what`, `why` | "I cannot do this without X." Rides the approval machinery **and** lands as a boardroom line, so the chairman fulfils it in one motion: credential stored, roles scoped, need approved. The answer may be a **file** (a service-account key, an SSH key), in which case the variable holds its path. |
| `POST /assists` | `what`, `context` | Hand a captcha, a 2FA prompt, or any human-only step to the chairman. Save session state to the workspace first; his answer rides back verbatim and wakes you. The platform never defeats a security challenge. |
| `POST /accounts` | `service`, `identity`, `owner` | Record an identity the project created in the world. Record-only, so winding down is a reading rather than an archaeology. |
| `GET /accounts` | — | What already exists, before you sign up for it again. |

## Side effects — the anti-double-fire ledger

```http
POST /side_effects            {"kind": "github_pr", "idempotency_key": "pr-fix-login-42", "task_id": "…", "payload": {…}}
POST /side_effects/{id}/finish {"ok": true, "result": {"url": "…"}}
```

**Call `side_effects` before any external action** — a PR, a deploy, a message
to an outside system. If a prior attempt under the same key completed, the
response says so and the agent must not fire again. This is what makes
reap-and-retry safe: no duplicate tweet, PR, or payment after a crash.

## Deliverables

| Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /artifacts` | `filename`, `content_base64` | Persist a finished deliverable to the artifact store. Agents reach this through the `artifact_put` tool, which takes a workspace **path** and reads the bytes itself — a deliverable must never be base64'd through a model's own output. |
| `GET /artifacts` | — | Everything this project has actually shipped. |
| `GET /artifacts/content` | `ref` | Read one back. A run token is scoped to its own project's artifacts, never the whole store. |

## Bulk data

The sandbox tool `data_fetch(server, tool, arguments, path)` calls a project
data source and writes the **whole** result to a workspace file, returning only
a path, size, digest and a 2 KB preview. Omit `tool` to list what a source
offers. It exists because an MCP tool result otherwise lands in the model's
context in full, billed by the token on that turn and every turn after — and
because counting and summing are things code does exactly and a model does
approximately. The sandbox ships `pandas` and `duckdb` for the processing half.

A data source marked `access: "bulk"` is **not mounted as tools at all**, so its
rows cannot reach a context by accident; `data_fetch` is the only way in. Mark
sources that serve rows as bulk and leave small-lookup sources `inline`.

---

## Writing a role that uses this well

A role is a JSON file in [`roles/`](/org/#roles):

```json
{
  "slug": "engineer",
  "name": "Software Engineer",
  "is_ceo_role": false,
  "description": "Builds and runs everything technical. Decides how, never what.",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-5",
  "effort": "xhigh",
  "tool_permissions": {"files": true, "bash": true,
                       "data_processing": true, "web": true},
  "secret_scopes": ["github"],
  "system_prompt": "…"
}
```

- `model` / `effort` — per role, so your writer isn't paying engineer prices.
- `tool_permissions` — `files`, `bash`, `data_processing`, `web`.
  `data_processing` grants the same shell
  `bash` does; it is separate so that a role which has one in order to aggregate
  data with code says so, rather than looking like it builds software. Grant it
  to any role that reads a data source — one that can fetch bulk data but not
  process it is worse off than one that never fetched it.
- `secret_scopes` — which named secrets get injected per run.
- `mcp_servers` is **refused here.** Data sources are project-owned and
  assigned to roles, so a server frozen into a template can't follow the role
  into a project that never heard of it.

Load with `yaaf seed-roles roles/`. Each load creates a **new version**; live
teams keep the version they pinned until you repin them.

### What good system prompts do

Read the shipped roles for the pattern. The ones that work:

- **Name the one verb per situation.** "Found a bug out of scope? File a
  suggestion" beats "be helpful about bugs" — the agent has an API, tell it
  which call.
- **Say what evidence looks like for this job.** "Quote the command and the
  output you actually saw" is checkable; "verify your work" isn't.
- **Verify the running thing, not the source.** Editing a file proves nothing
  about the live service.
- **Name the refusals it will hit and what to do instead**, so a 403 is a
  signpost rather than a wall to rephrase around. Refusals also cost — past
  `refusal_cap_per_run` the run's token is revoked.
- **Require `side_effect_begin` before anything external**, with a stable
  idempotency key.
- **One item per run.** Claim, do, complete or block. Don't collect work.

Prompt edits are gated by golden-transcript evals in [`evals/`](https://github.com/dominicplouffe/yaaf/tree/main/evals) — run
`pytest tests/test_golden_evals.py` after changing a shipped role.
